        Hey üëã, I&apos;m Wouter, {age} years old and passionate about all things digital really.

      <p className="mb-4">
        I studied Digital Design & Development at Howest University College and currently I&apos;m
        contracting as Full-stack Developer. I have over 10 years of experience as a professional
        web & mobile developer and the last few years, I&apos;ve been specializing in React, React
        Native & Node.js (web) applications. Before I started contracting I used to work for a
        variety of startups, scale-ups and agencies.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When I&apos;m not creating kickass digital applications, I&apos;m probably fiddling around
        with electronics using Arduino, ESP and Raspberry Pi. The restless mind that I am wants to
        learn and expand knowledge all the time. Besides that, I really love traveling, trying new
        things and pushing my own limits. Also kind of a data geek, charts & stats are real
        motivators for me.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Since 2017 involved in the crypto space and really started to appreciate the power of
        decentralized applications. And to be honest, it&apos;s probably one of the most exciting
        things I&apos;ve come across lately!
